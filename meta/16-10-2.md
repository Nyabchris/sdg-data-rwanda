layout: indicator
indicator_definition: The focus of this indicator is thus on the status of adoption and implementation of constitutional, statutory and/or   policy guarantees for public access to information. The definition relates directly to “public access to information”, which is wider       than, but is also very much based upon, the established fundamental freedoms of expression and association. Conversely, these freedoms     also both impact on the environment for public access to information.
